## On generating and editing pages for this wiki 

Due to limitations with Github's wiki implementation, the table of contents for each individual page is manually generated. In particular, the shell script at

https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc

(with a little postprocessing) generated the FAQ table of contents. If you add new entries, then please also update the table of contents accordingly.

Step by step on how to update the TOC:

```
git clone https://github.com/tjhei/github-markdown-toc
cd github-markdown-toc
./gh-md-toc https://github.com/dealii/dealii/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Question
```

and replace the TOC with the output.
